Original RTL files used for FPGA implementation are available at:

The main branch of the SoC-Design repository contains RTL files that have passed lint and basic quality checks and are intended as a stable baseline for SoC integration.

Future RTL updates will be introduced through separate branches and merged into main only after validation.
